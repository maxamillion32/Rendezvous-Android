Rendezvous is an event organising application with a user system and a database support.
The application allows users to create new events and subscribe others people's events as well
as following other users. Currently the application does not support push notifications but
hopefully we are going to implement it. 
To run the application you need to have AndroidStudio 1.1.0. You need to download Android Support
Library, Google APIs, Android Support Repository, Google Play Services, and for real devices you need to 
have at least API 14 ( Android 4.0 ).
